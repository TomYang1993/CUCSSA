    <h4>Comprehensive Promotion and Update of CUCSSA BBS</h4>
    <p>Hello! CUCSSA (Columbia University Chinese Students and Scholars Association) BBS has been updated to a new version and we will permanently terminate the old one. During building process of the new version, we widely collected the suggestions from old users, fixed different kinds of bugs, and redesigned the layout and landscaping of BBS. We hope all of you will like it.
</p>
    <p>The following are new major features:</p>
    <h5>New Layout and Landscaping</h5>
    <p>We redesign the layout of CUSSA BBS and combine several similar categories, which save the size and improve browse experience. We add “Back to Main Menu” function to the logo on top of each page. We also add searching bar in order to help users find resources by searching key words. Moreover, you can set either searching by contents or searching by users’ name. Besides, we add "quick navigation" link to the navigation bar.  You can look through posts and friend lists by just one click. For each category, we also add pictures for it. The theme of each category can be obviously to see, which significantly improves users’ browse experience. At last, we add a new category, “ Hodgepodge”. You can find different kinds of posts here including gossip and so on. 　
</p>
    <h5>Require Email Address of Columbia University to Sign in
</h5>
    <p>According to old BBS users, the biggest problem of previous BBS is that there are too many advertisements posted by people outside of school. Therefore, we ask all of new users use Columbia University’s Email to sign in. Then, the system will automatically send you a verification Email. The people who are failed to pass the verification can only browse BBS without posting or replying. We believe spam will disappear from new BBS.</p>
    <h5> Support Logging in by QQ Number
</h5>
    <p>Now, you can bind your QQ number with your verified BBS account number. Then, you can easily log in to BBS with QQ number, which is much more convenient. Meanwhile,you can set “show post and reply on Tencent MicroBlog and QQ Zone”, which can let more people take advantages of this useful information. However, if your accounts have not been verified through Columbia University’s Email yet, you can only browse BBS without posting or replying.
</p>
    <h5> Support Browse on Mobile Device</h5>
    <p>New BBS offers a simple version for browsing on cellphones. iPhone and Android cellphone users can also download App to enjoy better browse experience. You can easily find how to download App by just browsing through BBS on your cellphones. </p>
    <h5>Support Browse with either Wide Screen or Normal Screen</h5>
    <p>The button on the top right corner, “Switch to the Wide Screen Model” or “Switch to the Normal Screen Model”, offers two similar ways to display contents of BBS. It not only satisfies the requirement of users with wide-screen cell phones for better browse experience but also makes sure the basic browse requirement of normal-screen users.
</p>
    <h5> Browse Faster and Safer</h5>
    <p>The new server of BBS has been completely moved to the United States, which uses cloud technique. Therefore, browsing speed will be much faster. Meanwhile, we have applied several different types of security techniques to make sure the stability and security of BBS.</p>
